# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Repository

Welcome to the DSA repository! This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms, primarily in Java.
It's designed to aid in understanding and applying fundamental concepts in computer science.

## Table of Contents

- [Data Structures Implemented](#data-structures-implemented)
- [Algorithms Implemented](#algorithms-implemented)

## Data Structures Implemented

The repository includes implementations of the following data structures:

- **Linked Lists**
  - Single-Linked List
  - Double-Linked List
- **Stack**
- **Queue**
- **Deque**
- **Trees**
- **Red Black Binary Search Trees**
- **Trie**
- **Sparse Arrays**
- **Heaps**
- **Graphs**
- **HashMaps**

Each data structure is organized into its respective directory with relevant source code files.

## Algorithms Implemented

In addition to data structures, the repository features various algorithms, including:

- **Move Puzzle Solver** (`movepuzzle.py`): A Python script that solves move puzzles.
- **Utility Functions** (`util.py`): A collection of helper functions to support algorithm implementations.
